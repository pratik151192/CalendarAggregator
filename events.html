    <h2 id="8">Weiqi (围棋, the Game of Go), Sun Tzu, and the Chinese Way of War (10/24)</h2>

	<p><strong>Title</strong>: <span>Weiqi (围棋, the Game of Go), Sun Tzu, and the Chinese Way of War (10/24)</span></p>
    <p><strong>Start Time</strong>: <span>2013-10-24</span> - <strong>End Time</strong>: <span></span></p>
	
	
    <p><strong>Location</strong>: <span>113 IST Building, University Park 16802</span></p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: <span>ABSTRACT

Weiqi, or the game of Go, is a Chinese-invented board game. It is the world’s oldest board game; yet still arguably the most sophisticated and challenging one. In many ways, this game is a living reflection of Chinese culture, philosophy, strategic thinking, and operational art.

Most sports and games find their origins in human conflict. They turn deadly human confrontations into regulated competitions. The Olympic Games are prime examples. Weiqi is no exception.
Once created, sports and games also become part of culture. Culture influences human thinking and behavior in many ways. American football, for instance, finds its expressions in U.S. national security decision-making, diplomatic interactions, and above all, military undertakings. Weiqi as a Chinese cultural artifact is intrinsically connected to Sun Tzu’s Art of War and the Chinese way of war.

The presentation on Weiqi, Sun Tzu, and the Chinese Way of War will highlight the fundamentals of the Chinese strategic culture, Sun Tzu’s Art of War, and uses Weiqi to illustrate the Chinese way of strategic thinking and operational art.

DR. DAVID LAI

**********************
ABSTRACT

As an educator, my objective is to raise students’ consciousness of both the opportunities and problems that arise from our world’s growing reliance on information and communication technology (ICT). I do so by bringing a social justice perspective to the study of ICT and society. 

According to Adams, Bell and Griffin (1997), social justice education utilizes experiential pedagogical principles that help students to understand power relations expressed in oppressive systems that incite feelings of marginalization, exploitation of labor, threats of violence, cultural imperialism, and feelings of powerlessness. As students apply these themes to familiar ICTs and their digital culture, they become conscious of their operating worldview and are able to examine alternative ways of understanding the world and social relations. 

Social justice education has the potential to prepare students to become something more than technologists who are able to effectively design, implement and manage information systems. They are becoming people who are sophisticated in their understanding of social interactions amongst diverse groups, and are able to critique current technology arrangements and envision new possibilities for ICT and society.

	<p><strong>Title</strong>: <span>IST talk:  Informal Animation Sketching with K-Sketch</span></p>
    <p><strong>Start Time</strong>: <span>2011-05-31</span> - <strong>End Time</strong>: <span>2011-05-31</span></p>
	
	
    
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: <span>Abstract:
Informal interfaces capture ideas in natural expressive forms, such as sketching and speaking, to avoid the burden of specifying precise details. Animation is a perfect test bed for informal interfaces, because it is a powerful expressive medium, but current animation tools are either too restrictive or too complex. K-Sketch is a “kinetic” sketch pad for informal animation that allows users to create simple animations quickly and easily with sketching and hand gestures. To design K-Sketch, I analyzed 72 usage scenarios with a novel conceptual modeling technique called interface optimization. In this talk, I will present the K-Sketch interface and explain how interface optimization was used during the design process. I will also describe laboratory studies that show significant improvements over existing tools, show how K-Sketch is being used by both educators and designers, and explain how it is being extended to support prototyping of more polished animations and video games.

Google Scholar: The Adventure Continues

Google Scholar is a fresh look at the traditional problem of searching
for scholarly literature. We started down this road several years ago
with a simple-to-state goal - researchers everywhere should be able to
find  relevant work done by colleagues anywhere, Like all
simple-to-state goals, it came with many challenges. Dr. Acharya will describe the underlying principles and key features of Google Scholar and the approach to some of the challenges.</span></p>
